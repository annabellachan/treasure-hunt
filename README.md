# treasure-hunt
A treasure hunt game using simply Javascript, HTML and CSS. This was my first ever coding project that jumpstarted my coding career after joining LEARN Academy. 

This ocean theme treasure hunt game represents my love for the ocean and sea animals. The sea animals are hiding a diamond and you are only given a limited amount of tries. If you encounter a bomb, you lose the opportunity to find the diamond. Don't worry! You can always restart the game and find it again..... or not. 

Bonus: Check out more photos of fish below.
